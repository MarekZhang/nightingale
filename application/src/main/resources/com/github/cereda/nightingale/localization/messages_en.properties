ERROR_BASENAME_NOT_A_FILE=The ''basename'' method requires a file, not a directory. It looks like ''{0}'' does not appear to be a file at all. If you need to perform tasks on a directory, you could use a couple of methods from the Java API.
ERROR_CALCULATEHASH_IO_EXCEPTION=For whatever reason, I could not calculate the hash. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps the file was moved or deleted before or during the hashing operation. Or maybe I do not have the proper permissions to read the file.
ERROR_CHECK_INVALID_KEY=The ''check'' method requires a valid key. but it looks like ''{0}'' is not valid at all. This should be an easy fix: either try with a valid key, or add ''{0}'' to the list of arguments. Note that we have a couple of keywords that cannot be used, but I can spot them for you.
ERROR_CHECK_UNKNOWN_TYPE=The ''check'' method could not infer the type of the key ''{0}''. Make sure this key holds a valid string that represents boolean values (yes and no, true and false, 1 and 0, and on and off). This should be an easy fix. If you need to use another value, you can include your own verification.
ERROR_CHECKBOOLEAN_NOT_VALID_BOOLEAN=It looks like ''{0}'' is not a valid boolean value. This should be an easy fix. Make sure to use a valid string that represents boolean values (yes and no, true and false, 1 and 0, and on and off).
ERROR_CHECKCOMMANDS_COMMANDS_NOT_A_LIST=The 'commands' variable must be a list. You can even define this variable as an empty list, but that would not make any sense, would it? I mean, you probably want your rules to do something. Please correct the type to be a list and try again. This should be an easy fix.
ERROR_CHECKCOMMANDS_LIST_ELEMENT_MISSING_KEY=The ''{0}'' key is missing in one of the ''commands'' list elements. It is important to observe that ''commands'' is actually a list of maps, and each map must have the correct keys. This should be an easy fix, I am able to spot which keys are missing (it is what I am doing right now). Do not worry, make sure to include the ''{0}'' key to your map.
ERROR_CHECKCOMMANDS_LIST_ELEMENT_UNKNOWN_KEYS=The ''commands'' variable is a list of maps, and each map must have the correct keys (namely ''name'', ''command'' and ''exit''). Everything else is not valid. I found these unknown keys in one of the list elements: {0}. This should be an easy fix, just remove them from your map.
ERROR_CHECKCOMMANDS_LIST_ELEMENT_WRONG_CLASS_TYPE=The ''{0}'' key in one of the ''commands'' list elements has a wrong class type. It was expected ''{1}''. This should be an easy fix, just rewrite the key value in order to reflect the correct class type.
ERROR_CHECKCOMMANDS_LIST_ELEMENTS_NOT_A_MAP=The 'commands' variable is a list of maps, so each element of the list must be a map. Do not worry, it is a quite easy fix. Just correct the type and try again. Do not worry, I can spot a lot of errors, so hopefully  I will be able to help you.
ERROR_CHECKCOMMANDS_NULL_COMMANDS=The 'commands' variable cannot contain null elements. This is really worrisome. Please, do not use null values. You can even define ''commands'' as an empty list (although it does not make a lot of sense), but avoid, at all costs, using null values.
ERROR_CHECKCONFIGURATION_NOT_A_MAP=The 'config' variable in the provided configuration file must be a map. This should be an easy fix. Please correct the type and try again. Note that you can even use an empty map (although it does not make much sense on why you would do such thing). By all means, 'config' has to be a map.
ERROR_CHECKCONFIGURATION_NULL_VARIABLE=There is no 'config' variable in the provided configuration file. This variable is the most important element of my configuration framework. But do not despair, this should be an easy fix. Just create a new map variable named 'config' and add keys and values to it. It can also be an empty map, although it does not make much sense on why you would have an empty configuration file.
ERROR_CHECKCONFIGURATION_UNKNOWN_KEYS=I found a couple of unknown keys defined in the ''config'' map variable in the provided configuration file. These are the unknown keys I have spotted: {0}. This should be an easy fix, just remove them from your map.
ERROR_CHECKCONFIGURATION_WRONG_CLASS_TYPE=The key ''{0}'' defined in the ''config'' variable in the configuration file has a wrong class type. It was expected ''{1}''. This should be an easy fix, just rewrite the key value in order to reflect the correct class type.
ERROR_CHECKDUPLICATES_DUPLICATE_ELEMENTS=The list of arguments defined in the ''arguments'' key of the ''rule'' variable has duplicate elements. This is a very easy fix. Just remove the duplicates and try again.
ERROR_CHECKFILETYPES_NOT_A_FILETYPE=I was expecting a list of file types for the 'file_types' key in the provided configuration file. The fix should be easy. Correct the type of each element of the list and everything should work just fine. Note that you must provide the extension and search pattern for every file type you define. If the extension is already supported, you can either provide the extension (in case you want to change the file lookup order, but keeping the search pattern) or proceed as if it is a new file type.
ERROR_CHECKHEADER_ARGUMENTS_EMPTY_STRING=There is an empty element in the list of strings for the 'arguments' key in the 'rule' variable. This should be a quick fix. Just make sure each element of the list is not an empty string and everything should work just fine.
ERROR_CHECKHEADER_ARGUMENTS_NOT_A_STRING_LIST=I was expecting a list of strings for the 'arguments' key in the 'rule' variable. This should be a quick fix. Just make sure each element of the list is a string and everything should work just fine.
ERROR_CHECKHEADER_AUTHORS_EMPTY_STRING=There is an empty element in the list of strings for the 'authors' key in the 'rule' variable. This should be a quick fix. Just make sure each element of the list is not an empty string and everything should work just fine.
ERROR_CHECKHEADER_AUTHORS_NOT_A_STRING_LIST=I was expecting a list of strings for the 'authors' key in the 'rule' variable. This should be a quick fix. Just make sure each element of the list is a string and everything should work just fine.
ERROR_CHECKHEADER_NULL_RULE_HEADER=There is no 'rule' variable in the provided rule. This variable plays an important role, so it must be defined. This should be easy. Just create a new map variable named 'rule' and add keys and values to it. Note that this map must contain specific keys. Do not worry, I am able to help you by telling which elements are missing and how to fix them.
ERROR_CHECKHEADER_RULE_HEADER_MISSING_KEY=The ''{0}'' key is missing in the ''rule'' variable. This should be an easy fix. Please add the key and the corresponding value to the ''rule'' map.
ERROR_CHECKHEADER_RULE_HEADER_NOT_A_MAP=The 'rule' variable in the provided rule is not a map. Do not worry, it is a quite easy fix. Please correct the class type and make sure 'rule' is map.
ERROR_CHECKHEADER_RULE_HEADER_UNKNOWN_KEYS=The ''rule'' variable is a map and must have the correct keys (namely ''id'', ''name'', ''arguments'', ''description'', ''authors'' and ''requires''). Everything else is not valid. I found these unknown keys: {0}. This should be an easy fix, just remove them from your map.
ERROR_CHECKHEADER_RULE_HEADER_WRONG_CLASS_TYPE=The key ''{0}'' in the ''rule'' map variable has a wrong class type. It was expected ''{1}''. This should be an easy fix, just rewrite the key value in order to reflect the correct class type.
ERROR_CHECKKEYWORDS_ELEMENT_IS_RESERVED=It looks like ''{0}'' is a reserved keyword and cannot be used in the ''arguments'' list. This should be an easy fix. Just replace it by another name. If the new name is reserved, I will tell you, do not worry.
ERROR_CHECKOS_INVALID_OPERATING_SYSTEM=I could not check your operating system. The provided value ''{0}'' does not look like a valid operating system entry in my list (I might also be wrong, of course). Please correct the value and try again.
ERROR_CHECKPATHS_NOT_A_STRING=The provided rule paths in the 'rule_paths' key in the provided configuration file are not proper strings. This should be an easy fix, just rewrite the key value in order to reflect the correct class type. Note that if the path is not absolute, it will be appended to the base path of the main file.
ERROR_CHECKREGEX_IO_EXCEPTION=I could not read the contents of the file ''{0}'', I got an IO error. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps the file was moved or deleted before or during the reading operation. Or maybe I do not have the proper permissions to read the file.
ERROR_CHECKVERSION_VERSION_TOO_OLD=I cannot interpret the current rule because apparently I am too old. My current version is {0}, but the rule requires at least version {1}.
ERROR_CONFIGURATION_LOOPS_INVALID_RANGE=The value defined in the 'maximum_number_of_loops' key in the configuration file in order to denote the maximum number of loops has an invalid range. Please make sure to use a positive long value.
ERROR_CONFIGURATION_TIMEOUT_INVALID_RANGE=The value defined in the 'timeout_value' key in the configuration file in order to denote the execution timeout has an invalid range. Please make sure to use a positive long value. Note that the default unit is in milliseconds, but this setting can be overriden in the configuration file.
ERROR_DISCOVERFILE_FILE_NOT_FOUND=I could not find the provided file ''{0}'' {1}. Please make sure the file exists and it has a valid extension.
ERROR_ENSURE_DIFFERENT_SIZES=The ''ensure'' method requires both lists to be of the same size. Currently, the first list has {0} elements while the second list has {1} elements. This should be a easy fix. Just make both lists match sizes and it should work.
ERROR_ENSURE_UNKNOWN_KEY=There was an attempt of setting an unknown key ''{0}'' through the ''ensure'' method. This should be an easy fix. Either replace the unknown key or add ''{0}'' to the ''arguments'' list of the ''rule'' variable in your rule.
ERROR_EVALUATE_COMPILATION_FAILED=For whatever reason, I could not compile the expression in the provided conditional. This part is tricky, since it envolves aspects of the underlying scripting language. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_EVALUATE_GENERIC_EXCEPTION=There was an error while trying to evaluate the provided conditional. This part is tricky, since it envolves aspects of the underlying scripting language. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_EVALUATE_NOT_BOOLEAN_VALUE=The conditional evaluation was expecting a boolean value. This should be an easy fix. Just make sure the conditional evaluation resolves to a boolean value in the end.
ERROR_EXTRACTOR_IO_ERROR=There was an IO error while I was trying to extract the directives. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps the file was moved or deleted before or during the hashing operation. Or maybe I do not have the proper permissions to read the file.
ERROR_FILETYPE_NOT_A_FILE=The ''filetype'' method requires a file, not a directory. It looks like ''{0}'' does not appear to be a file at all. If you need to perform tasks on a directory, you could use a couple of methods from the Java API.
ERROR_FILETYPE_UNKNOWN_EXTENSION=I cannot recognize ''{0}'' as a default extension. If you want to define a new file type, make sure to provide the extension and pattern. These are the default extensions: {1}
ERROR_GETAPPLICATIONPATH_ENCODING_EXCEPTION=There was an encoding problem while trying to obtain the application path. There is nothing much I can do about it.
ERROR_GETCANONICALFILE_IO_EXCEPTION=I could not get the canonical file due to an IO error. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps the file was moved or deleted before or during the lookup operation. Or maybe I do not have the proper permissions.
ERROR_GETCANONICALPATH_IO_EXCEPTION=I could not get the canonical path due to an IO error. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps the file was moved or deleted before or during the lookup operation. Or maybe I do not have the proper permissions.
ERROR_GETPARENTCANONICALPATH_IO_EXCEPTION=I could not get the parent canonical path due to an IO error. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps the file was moved or deleted before or during the hashing operation. Or maybe I do not have the proper permissions.
ERROR_INTERPRETER_COMPILATION_FAILED=I could not compile the rule. Apparently, something bad happened. This part is tricky, since it envolves aspects of the underlying scripting language. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_INTERPRETER_GENERIC_EXCEPTION=There was an error while trying to interpret the rule. This part is tricky, since it envolves aspects of the underlying scripting language. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_INTERPRETER_IO_EXCEPTION=There was an IO error while trying to interpret the rule. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps the file was moved or deleted before or during the reading operation. Or maybe I do not have the proper permissions to read the file.
ERROR_INTERPRETER_MISSING_PROPERTY=Apparently there was an error about a missing property while trying to interpret the rule. But I am not sure. This part is tricky, since it envolves aspects of the underlying scripting language. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_INTERPRETER_NULL_COMMAND_LIST=One of elements of the 'commands' list had returned null as value for the 'command' key. This is bad, really bad. Please, make sure to rewrite the value in order to never return null.
ERROR_INTERPRETER_RULE_NOT_FOUND=I could not find a rule named ''{0}'' in the provided rule paths. Perhaps a misspelled word? I was looking for a file named ''{0}.groovy'' in the following paths in order of priority: {1}
ERROR_INTERPRETER_WRONG_EXIT_CLOSURE_RETURN=The 'exit' closure of a 'commands' element must always have one parameter and return a boolean value (even if there is no computation in the closure body). This should be an easy fix: make sure to correct the type return statement and try again.
ERROR_LANGUAGE_INVALID_CODE=The provided language code is invalid. Currently, I know how to speak the following languages: {0}
ERROR_LOAD_COULD_NOT_LOAD_XML=I could not load the XML database named ''{0}''. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps the file was moved or deleted before or during the reading operation. Or maybe I do not have the proper permissions to read the file. By the way, make sure the XML file is well-formed.
ERROR_OBTAIN_INVALID_KEY=The ''obtain'' method requires a valid key. but it looks like ''{0}'' is not valid at all. This should be an easy fix: either try with a valid key, or add ''{0}'' to the list of arguments. Note that we have a couple of keywords that cannot be used, but I can spot them for you.
ERROR_PARSER_LOOPS_INVALID_RANGE=The value defined in the command line for the maximum number of loops has an invalid range. Please make sure to use a positive long value.
ERROR_PARSER_LOOPS_NAN=The maximum number of loops option expects a number as argument. This should be an easy fix. Just make sure to provide a positive long value.
ERROR_PARSER_TIMEOUT_INVALID_RANGE=The value defined in the command line for the execution timeout has an invalid range. Please make sure to use a positive long value. Note that the default unit is in milliseconds, but this setting can be overriden in the configuration file.
ERROR_PARSER_TIMEOUT_NAN=The execution timeout option expects a number as argument. This should be an easy fix. Just make sure to provide a positive long value. Note that the default unit is in milliseconds, but this setting can be overriden in the configuration file.
ERROR_REPLICATELIST_MISSING_FORMAT_ARGUMENTS_EXCEPTION=I could not replicate the list due to a missing format argument. My guess is that there are less (or more) parameters than expected. Make sure to correct the number of parameters and try again.
ERROR_REQUIRED_INVALID_KEY=The ''required'' method requires a valid key. but it looks like ''{0}'' is not valid at all. This should be an easy fix: either try with a valid key, or add ''{0}'' to the list of arguments. Note that we have a couple of keywords that cannot be used, but I can spot them for you.
ERROR_RULE_IDENTIFIER_AND_PATH=I have spotted an error in rule ''{0}'' located at ''{1}''.
ERROR_RUN_GENERIC_EXCEPTION=I could not run the provided system command, something bad happened. This part is tricky, since it envolves aspects of the underlying scripting language. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_RUN_INTERRUPTED_EXCEPTION=The provided system command execution was suddenly interrupted. Maybe there was an external interruption that forced the command to end abruptly.
ERROR_RUN_INVALID_EXIT_VALUE_EXCEPTION=The provided system command execution has returned an invalid exit value.
ERROR_RUN_IO_EXCEPTION=The system command execution has failed due to an IO error. Are you sure the provided system command exists in your path? It might be a good idea to check the path and see if the command is available.
ERROR_RUN_TIMEOUT_EXCEPTION=The system command execution reached the provided timeout value and was aborted. If the time was way too short, make sure to provide a longer value.
ERROR_RUN_TIMEOUT_INVALID_RANGE=The timeout value in the configuration file is probably missing (although timeout is enabled). This should be an easy fix. Please add the corresponding value to the configuration file or remove all timeout options.
ERROR_SAVE_COULD_NOT_SAVE_XML=I could not save the XML database named ''{0}''. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps I do not have the proper permissions to write the XML file to disk.
ERROR_SESSION_OBTAIN_UNKNOWN_KEY=The ''obtain'' method has found an unknown key ''{0}'' in the session scope. I could not get something I do not have in the first place. Please enter a valid key and try again.
ERROR_SESSION_REMOVE_UNKNOWN_KEY=The ''remove'' method has found an unknown key ''{0}'' in the session scope. I could not remove something I do not have in the first place. Please enter a valid key and try again.
ERROR_TRIGGER_ACTION_NOT_FOUND=The trigger action ''{0}'' was not found. Make sure to take a look at the list of all available triggers and try again.
ERROR_TRIGGER_CALL_EXCEPTION=The trigger action ''{0}'' could not be called. Something really bad happened.
ERROR_VALIDATE_EMPTY_FILES_LIST=I read a directive {0} and found out that the provided ''files'' list is empty. This is an easy fix: make sure the list has at least one element and try again.
ERROR_VALIDATE_FILE_IS_RESERVED=I read a directive {0} and found out that the key ''file'' was used. This key is reserved, so you cannot use it. But do not worry, this should be an easy fix. Just replace it by another name.
ERROR_VALIDATE_FILES_IS_NOT_A_LIST=I read a directive {0} and found out that ''files'' requires a list. Please make sure to correct the type to a proper list and try again.
ERROR_VALIDATE_INVALID_DIRECTIVE_FORMAT=I spotted an invalid directive {0} in the provided file. Make sure to fix the directive and try again.
ERROR_VALIDATE_NO_DIRECTIVES_FOUND=It looks like no directives were found in the provided file. Make sure to include at least one directive and try again.
ERROR_VALIDATE_ORPHAN_LINEBREAK=Apparently there is an orphan directive line break in line {0}. I cannot proceed. Please correct the directive and try again.
ERROR_VALIDATE_YAML_EXCEPTION=There was a problem with the provided YAML map in a directive {0}. This part is tricky, since it envolves aspects of the underlying serialization language.
ERROR_VALIDATEARGUMENTS_INVALID_KEYS=I spotted a couple of invalid keys in a directive {0}: {1}
ERROR_VALIDATECONFIGURATION_COMPILATION_FAILED=I could not validate the provided configuration file due to a compilation failure. This part is tricky, since it envolves aspects of the underlying scripting language. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_VALIDATECONFIGURATION_GENERIC_EXCEPTION=I could not validate the provided configuration file. Apparently, something bad happened. This part is tricky, since it envolves aspects of the underlying scripting language. I will do my best to help you in any way I can.
ERROR_VALIDATECONFIGURATION_IO_EXCEPTION=I could not validate the provided configuration file due to an IO error. I have no idea why it failed, though. Perhaps the file was moved or deleted before or during the reading operation. Or maybe I do not have the proper permissions to read the file.
ERROR_VALIDATECONFIGURATION_UNSUPPORTED_CHARSET=I could not validate the provided configuration file. Apparently, you provided an unsupported charset value for the ''directive_charset'' key. Please correct the charset and try again.
ERROR_VALIDATEIDENTIFIER_WRONG_IDENTIFIER=The rule has a wrong identifier. I was expecting ''{0}'', but found ''{1}''. This should be an easy fix: just replace the wrong identifier by the correct one.
INFO_DISPLAY_EXCEPTION_MORE_DETAILS=There are more details available on this exception:
INFO_DISPLAY_EXECUTION_TIME=Total: {0} seconds
INFO_DISPLAY_FILE_INFORMATION=Processing ''{0}'' (size: {1}, last modified: {2}), please wait.
INFO_INTERPRETER_DRYRUN_MODE_BOOLEAN_MODE=Although executing in dry-run mode, this entry is always processed since it relies on computation done in the rule scope. The resulting command is actually a boolean value indicating if the processing should continue or not.
INFO_INTERPRETER_DRYRUN_MODE_SYSTEM_COMMAND=About to run: {0}
INFO_INTERPRETER_DRYRUN_MODE_TRIGGER_MODE=Although executing in dry-run mode, this entry is always processed since it is a trigger. Note that the effects of a trigger might influence the current execution.
INFO_INTERPRETER_VERBOSE_MODE_BOOLEAN_MODE=This entry relies on computation done in the rule scope, so there is not much to see in here, apart from this message.
