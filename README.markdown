## Introduction

`nightingale` is yet another automation tool. I wrote it primarily as a code sandbox for `arara`, where I could test new features and eventually port them to the existing tool. But of course `nightingale` grew up to be a first class automation tool and it is stable enough to be used in production. The idea is to keep both tools, since they have different approaches, and one codebase can benefit from the other.

## Usage

I am still writing rules to `nightingale`, so it might take a while. Hopefully, I will update this repository periodically, so users might be able to test new and great features. And I also need to write a manual for it. It is worth mentioning again: `nightingale` has production quality code.

## Requirements

As its older brother `arara`, `nightingale` is written in Java, so if you have a virtual machine installed, you are able to run it. I wrote it with portability in mind, so `nightingale` runs on Java 1.5+ and all JVM vendors.
